        <h2>Butter Chicken</h2>
        <p>The dish was developed in 1947 by founders of Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The dish was made "by chance" by mixing the leftover chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter and cream. In 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh Makhani" (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The dish is common in India and many other countries.</p>

            <h4>Method</h4>
            <p> Roughly chop the tomatoes. Put them into a large mixer jar and grind to a puree.
                 Put the puree into a non-stick pan. Rinse the jar with a little water and add to the pan, mix and let it cook. 
                 Add cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms, salt and 1½ tsps Kashmiri red chilli powder and mix well. Cover and cook till the mixture thickens slightly and all the flavours blend well.</p>
            <p>
                Put a little water in the lower container of the Gas Oven Tandoor and keep it on heat.
                Make a few incisions on either side of the chicken pieces and put them into a large bowl.
                Add lemon juice, salt and 1 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder and mix well and keep the bowl in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>Roughly chop ginger, garlic and 1 green chilli and add to the pan. Cover and cook.
                To make the 2nd marinade put yogurt into another large bowl.  Add salt, 1 tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder, 2 tbsps freshly ground ginger-garlic paste and freshly ground garam masala powder and mix well.
                Add the marinated chicken pieces to this bowl and mix well. Add mustard oil and mix well. Let it marinate in the refrigerator preferably for at least 4 hours.</p>
            <p>
                Strain the tomato mixture into a third large bowl. 
                 Lightly grease the upper container of the Gas Oven Tandoor. Keep the marinated chicken pieces on it, cover and cook. 
                 Heat butter and 1 tbsp oil in another non-stick pan. Add ½ tbsp ginger-garlic paste and saute till fragrant. Add the strained tomato mixture, readymade tomato puree, dried fenugreek leaves powder and honey and mix well and cook. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the chicken is almost done, baste the pieces with a little oil, cover and cook till  the chicken is completely done.
                 Finely chop coriander leaves and 1 green chilli and add to the tomato gravy. 
                 Cut the chicken into smaller pieces and add to the gravy. Add cream and mix well. Sprinkle a little garam masala powder and mix well.
